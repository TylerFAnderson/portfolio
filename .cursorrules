# Portfolio Project Rules

## Project Overview
- **Owner**: Tyler Anderson - Senior Product Designer
- **Live Site**: https://tyleranderson.me
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/TylerFAnderson/portfolio
- **Purpose**: Personal portfolio built to learn coding while showcasing design work

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Components**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Email**: Resend
- **Deployment**: Vercel (auto-deploys from main branch)

## Code Quality Standards
- Write **principal-level code** - production-ready, best practices
- Use **TypeScript strict mode** - full type safety
- Prefer **Server Components** by default, Client Components only when needed
- Follow **Next.js 15 patterns** - Server Actions, Metadata API, etc.
- Keep code **clean, maintainable, and well-commented**
- No shortcuts - always use optimal patterns

## File Organization
- **Content data**: Lives in `src/lib/data/`
- **Page content**: Lives in `src/components/sections/`
- **UI components**: Lives in `src/components/ui/` (shadcn - rarely edit)
- **Layouts**: Lives in `src/components/layout/`
- **Animations**: Lives in `src/components/animations/`
- **Types**: Lives in `src/types/`
- **Config**: Lives in `src/config/`

## Documentation
- Keep `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` updated at logical checkpoints:
  - After adding new pages or major features
  - When folder structure changes
  - After significant redesigns
  - NOT for small bug fixes or CSS tweaks
- Update `STATUS.md` when completing major milestones
- Commit messages should be descriptive and clear

## Design & Development Preferences
- **Pixel-perfect precision** - Tyler is detail-oriented about CSS
- **Smooth animations** - Use Framer Motion for professional effects
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, semantic HTML, keyboard nav
- **Responsive** - Mobile-first approach, perfect on all devices
- **Dark mode** - Thoughtfully designed for both themes

## Code Style
- Use modern Tailwind utilities (e.g., `shrink-0` not `flex-shrink-0`)
- Prefer composition over props drilling
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript types, not `any`
- Comment complex logic to explain "why"

## Learning & Explanations
- **Always explain the "why"** behind technical decisions
- Tyler has limited coding experience but can handle intermediate explanations
- Be concise for simple stuff, detailed for complex topics
- This is a learning project - maximize learning opportunities

## Deployment Workflow
- **Main branch** = Production (tyleranderson.me)
- Small fixes: Push directly to main
- Major changes: Use feature branches with Vercel preview deployments
- Environment variables are set in Vercel (RESEND_API_KEY)
- Auto-deploys on git push

## Git Configuration
- **Email**: ttyleranderson@gmail.com (personal, not Datadog)
- **GPG signing**: Disabled for this project
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive

## Content Management
- Projects: Edit `src/lib/data/projects.ts`
- Experience: Edit `src/lib/data/experience.ts`
- Skills: Edit `src/lib/data/skills.ts`
- Social links: Edit `src/lib/data/social.ts`
- Site config: Edit `src/config/site.ts`
- Images: Add to `public/images/projects/`

## Current Status
- ✅ Production-ready portfolio is live
- ✅ All core pages built (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
- ✅ Contact form sends real emails via Resend
- ✅ Custom domain connected with SSL
- 🎨 Next phase: Design overhaul from Figma

## Future Plans
- Tyler will design in Figma
- Implement visual redesign while maintaining technical foundation
- Add real project content and images
- Potential features: blog, case studies, more animations

## Notes
- This is Tyler's **Personal** profile project (separate from Datadog work)
- Prioritize clean, understandable code - this is a learning experience
- When in doubt, explain the reasoning behind architectural choices
