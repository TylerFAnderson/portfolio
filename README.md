## About This Project

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch to showcase my design work while simultaneously learning modern web development. It's a testament to the idea that designers can (and should) understand the medium they're designing for.

## Tech Stack

Built with modern, production-grade technologies:

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better DX
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **shadcn/ui** - Accessible component primitives
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting

## Highlights

- ⚡️ **Performance-first**: Server components, code splitting, and optimized assets
- 🎨 **Pixel-perfect design**: Every detail carefully crafted
- ♿️ **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- 🌗 **Dark mode**: Thoughtfully designed for both themes
- 📱 **Responsive**: Seamless experience across all devices

## Development Philosophy

This project represents my journey from design to code. Every component was built with the same attention to detail I bring to my design work—clean, maintainable, and built to last.
